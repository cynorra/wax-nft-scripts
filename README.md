# wax-nft-scripts
I made some utilitaries for basic interactions on Wax blockchain. I use them daily and you may like them!
_ mann000 <t.me/mann0000>, tips appreciated (dsnqy.wam) 

# Prerequisites
These scripts are written for Node.js and interact with Wax blockchain. You therefore need:
* A Wax account with a private key. Use Scatter to get one and then activate it. The key does not leave the script.
* Basic knowledge of Node.js: you have to install it and then install that repository dependencies to make it run (npm install).
* An active Internet connection: the scripts make calls to a Wax RPC. You therefore need an Internet connection.

Please note that I am a spaghetti code writer, not your professional dev. Pull requests about optimizations or documentation are warmly welcome!


# Where to run this?
The scripts can run manually on your average computer. Download them, install dependencies et voil√†!

If you plan to run them automatically, Heroku has a free tier and a [great guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs). Please follow usual secure coding best practices - especially not hardcoding your credentials - before any upload.
